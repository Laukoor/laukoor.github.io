I am currently a graduate student at [TreesLab](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vp9b0jNsEdg8Pwyi09X_FA) led by Prof. [Ran Tu (涂然)](https://scholar.google.cz/citations?user=ueR4KsUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) in school of transportation, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) (SEU). I have a broad interest in transportation issues and a belief that data and smart technologies could help us better solve these problems. My long-term goal is to help reshape cities to achieve ***efficiency***, ***equity*** and ***sustainability*** by transport planning and management.
